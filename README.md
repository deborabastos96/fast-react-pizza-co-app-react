# Fast React Pizza Co.

## Overview
Fast React Pizza Co. is a single-page application designed to streamline the pizza ordering process for customers, allowing them to order pizzas for delivery to their homes. Customers simply need to provide their name and will be redirected to the menu, where they can select their desired pizzas and quantities and add them to their cart. Once they have finished selecting their order, they can proceed to the cart to complete the order process.
